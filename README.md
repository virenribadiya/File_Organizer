# Project Title : File Organizer


## Project Statement:

Once a faculty had to check assignments from the LMS. He downloaded 130+ assignments which were submitted in various formats. He explored the “Download Folder” and realized that it contained 100+ files of different formats. It was crucial to organizing the files of different formats such as txt, pdf, xls, doc, jpg, mp4, etc. Locating assignment files was like finding a needle in a haystack. Similar is the case with many other directories. In order to organize all such files based on the extension, categories, and by particular timespan (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, etc) is very tedious as well as time-consuming.
