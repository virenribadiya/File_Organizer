# Project Title : File Organizer


## Project Statement:

Once a faculty had to check assignments from the LMS. He downloaded 130+ assignments which were submitted in various formats. He explored the “Download Folder” and realized that it contained 100+ files of different formats. It was crucial to organizing the files of different formats such as txt, pdf, xls, doc, jpg, mp4, etc. Locating assignment files was like finding a needle in a haystack. Similar is the case with many other directories. In order to organize all such files based on the extension, categories, and by particular timespan (Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, etc) is very tedious as well as time-consuming.


## Background / History of the problem:

In this digital era, the majority of people are habituated to using default paths while downloading files. As a result, lots of files get gathered in a download directory, and that too in an unorganized manner.

To sort and organize these files is a tedious and time-consuming task, especially when you have 500+ files accumulated. Further, it becomes more hectic when one needs to organize it based on the categories and year/month/date of creation.

For instance, in the photos directory, we have 1000s of photos that are required to be arranged in different manners with a proper directory structure. This work can be automated with minimal time and save human energy.

## Clarifying/Providing constraints:
There are many ways through which files can be organized with a proper directories structure such as,
category wise(Docs, Photos, Audio, Videos, etc),
extension wise(.mp3, .mp4, .mkv, etc),
nested folder structure (Year->Month->Week), etc.
Given the complex nature of the problem, your goal is to design an automated script that will provide various options for arranging files with minimum time.
